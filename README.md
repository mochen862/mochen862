### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Mo Chen and I work as a ğŸ“Š Data & Analytics Analyst within the ğŸ’µ Financial Services Industry. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and a ğŸ“– Masterâ€™s degree in Finance and Economics.

I really enjoy connecting with like-minded data people, sharing my skills, experience and personal journey within the world of data - which is why I started my YouTube channel [@data with mo](https://www.youtube.com/@datawithmo).
